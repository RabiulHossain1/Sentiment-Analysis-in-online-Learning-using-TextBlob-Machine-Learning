â€”Online education has grown significantly in
popularity over the last several years, providing students with
a flexible and convenient way to study. Despite its many
benefits, this flexible approach of learning requires ongoing
assessment and feedback to ensure that it is being improved
and improved. In order to develop a model that can accurately
classify learner attitudes as positive, negative, or neutral, this
study explores the field of sentiment analysis in the context of
online course feedback. In this study, we analyzed the students'
sentiments regarding their courses based on their feedback on
online courses and tried to predict their sentiments. We have
used the Coursera Course Reviews Dataset, which contains
107018 data records of used reviews and comments.
Six machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
Random Forests, and the AdaBoost) were applied with four
performance measurement metrics. One of our models,
Logistic Regression, outperformed the other models with an
accuracy of 97.31%. Our findings demonstrate that our model
achieved the highest possible accuracy compared to previous
relevant studies in this particular domain.
